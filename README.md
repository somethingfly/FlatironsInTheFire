# FlatironsInTheFire
A collection of little possible errors and likely mistakes of probably little importance, and a few asides also of little importance, from reading Flatiron course materials that I have recorded as I went through the Flatiron course.

### What is this?

A collection of little possible errors and likely mistakes of probably little importance, and a few asides also of little importance, from reading Flatiron course materials that I have recorded as I went through the Flatiron course. 

### Why then?

As I was going through Flatiron PreWork and Phase 1, I would sometimes find little mistakes or oversights.  But I wasn't sure what to do about them.

Having seen and reported my share of bugs in the wild, I know that when there's a critical flaw that needs to be brought to a developer's attention, because it might cause Production to go down or cause the company/developer to lose data or, worse, money...  The developer is generally thankful.  But when there is something non-critical brought to their attention...  That's when the developer might grumble and put it deep in their backlog, but frankly they probably wish you hadn't brought it to their attention in the first place.

"Grumble, grumble... yeah... thanks user... thank you for carefully detailing your environment and the steps you took... yes, I can reproduce the error... yes, that webpage that my logs show gets approximately 1 visit every five years... yes, it is indeed missing an oxford comma in the second to last paragraph...  thanks so much...  grumble, grumble."

What to do then?  Well, I wrote the url down in a notepad .txt, along with whatever it was that was wrong, and what to fix, and moved on.  Because I'd be spending all my time opening bug reports that again, may be of no interest to anyone, and I was (and am) perpetually behind in my studies.

### Why now?

Well, the end of Phase 1 requires both: A) a blog B) a project.  And I am, again, behind in my progress, per the aforementioned "perpetually."  I need to kill two birds with one stone.  Or, rather, two reqs with one commit.  Also gotta be DRY.  (Which, I have in one of my notepad .txts, was used as an acronym often, but never actually spelled out in any of the course materials [until finally in the instructions for this project](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-javascript-project-mode).  DRY, by the way, stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself."  And, yes, one should be DRY.  But one should actually DMALTFT: "Do Mention At Least The First Time.")

I have to admit, there kinda already are plenty of blogging solutions out there.  But I need to pick a project that isn't too ambitious a project.  Because... I know I gotta be DRY, but I also gotta mention this third time...  that I am super behind.  Like, I-gotta-do-this-project-_this-weekend_-or-I-am-going-to-get-kicked-out behind.  I wish it was because I was lazy.  Seriously.  Because then I would only have one thing holding me back that I would need to fix.  But the reality is I have _a lot_ of other things going on right now.  I got way too many irons in the fire...  Now I got Flatirons in the fire too.

      "comment": "Replit.com has a new mode called \"Spooky\" that is pretty much unreadable that is used by default if you do not have an account. Go to https://replit.com/languages/javascript on a clean browser (i.e. no account), and spooky will be used by default. Notice that instead of \"1 console.log('Hello, world!')\", it looks like \"1 .log[]'Hello, World'[]\" . This is easy to replicate by creating a replit account, selecting Dark or Light as your theme, typing the aforementioned, then changing the theme to \"spooky\" and it becomes unreadable. You should interact with replit to get them to change the default no-account display, or update your course materials, or consider an alternative like codepen.",
